# Inception - Docker Project

## Introduction
**Inception** is a project developed as part of the curriculum at 42 school, designed to enhance understanding and proficiency in system administration through the practical utilization of `Docker`. The project delves into the realm of virtualization, employing Docker to create and manage multiple Docker images/containers within a virtual machine environment.

## Key Features
- **Docker Virtualization**: Utilizes Docker to create isolated environments for running various applications, facilitating efficient resource utilization and scalability.
- **Dockerfile Configuration**: Participants learn to create and customize Dockerfiles, defining the environment and dependencies required for each containerized application.
- **Virtual Machine Deployment**: Inception employs virtual machines to host Docker containers, providing a sandboxed environment for experimentation and learning.

## Installation
To get started with cub3d, follow the steps below:
1. Clone the repository via:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nunovaladao/42_Inception_lev5.git
```

2. Move into the repository directory:
```bash
cd 42_Inception_lev5
```

3. Build the project using the provided Makefile:
 - You will need to change some values in `.env_example` (change is name to `.env` either and **move to ./srcs**) and put some values in **secret files**;
```bash
make
```

## Skills and Competencies Acquired

During the development of the **Inception** project, I acquired and strengthened various skills and competencies, including:

- **Docker Knowledge**: Through building Docker images for WordPress, MariaDB, and Nginx, i gained a comprehensive understanding of Docker fundamentals, including containerization, Dockerfiles, and Docker Compose.
- **Container Orchestration**: By utilizing Docker Compose to manage multiple Docker containers and their interdependencies, i developed skills in container orchestration, ensuring seamless coordination between the WordPress, MariaDB, and Nginx services.
- **Service Configuration**: Configuring each service (WordPress, MariaDB, and Nginx) to work together effectively requires a deep understanding of their individual requirements and dependencies. This project honed my ability to configure services within Docker containers to achieve optimal performance and compatibility.
- **Networking**: Understanding how Docker containers communicate with each other and with external networks is crucial for deploying multi-service applications. By setting up networking configurations within Docker Compose, i gained practical experience in networking concepts such as port mapping and container linking.
- **Resource Management**: Managing resource allocation and utilization within Docker containers is essential for ensuring efficient performance. Through optimizing resource allocation for the WordPress, MariaDB, and Nginx containers, i developed skills in resource management and optimization.
- **Troubleshooting and Debugging**: Working with Docker and configuring multiple services inevitably involves encountering errors and debugging issues. Throughout the project, i likely honed my troubleshooting skills, learning to diagnose and resolve common Docker-related problems effectively.
- **Scripting and Automation**: As i iteratively built and tested Docker images, i may have leveraged scripting and automation techniques to streamline repetitive tasks, such as Dockerfile creation and Docker image building. This project provided an opportunity to enhance my scripting skills, potentially using tools like Bash.
- **Documentation**: Documenting the setup process, configurations, and any customizations made to the Docker images is crucial for maintaining clarity and enabling reproducibility. By documenting my work, i not only reinforced my understanding of the project but also cultivated skills in technical writing and documentation.


## Conclusion
Overall, working on this project provided a comprehensive learning experience in Docker, system administration, and web application deployment, equipping you with valuable skills and competencies applicable to various software development and IT roles.
